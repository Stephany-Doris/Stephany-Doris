Am a Software engineer from Kenya, currently working at Twiga Foods Ltd.
I mostly work with JavaScript(particularly ReactJS & NodeJS) to provide solutions and find better ways of implementing systems. 

Some of the areas am currently exploring include; serverless technologies, design systems and user centered design.
