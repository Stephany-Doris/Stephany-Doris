Am a Software engineer from Kenya, currently working at Twiga Foods Ltd.
I mostly work with JavaScript frameworks(particularly ReactJS & NodeJS) to build solutions and improve existing systems. Am also well vast in computer science principals and fundamentals. I have a passion for tooling and system architecture and design.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that are centered around solving real world problems or innovative problems i.e building a solution that does not exist or is not yet widely adopted in the industry yet.
