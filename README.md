## Hi, I'm Stephany! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephany-Doris/Stephany-Doris/main/wave.gif" width="30px"> 
Am a frontend software engineer from Kenya, currently working at Twiga Foods Ltd. 
I mostly work with ReactJS and GraphQL to provide solutions that are tailored at improving user experience. 

I have a passion for learning and am always looking forward to a challenge. I aim to provide solutions to problems, improve performance, and always have the user in mind. My areas of interest include, serverless technologies, design systems and user centered design.

## &#x270d; Blog & Writing
Apart from coding, I enjoy blogging about the different things that I learn and tell the story from my point of view. You can find my articles at [Medium](https://medium.com/@steph-ny)
